##### Open-source sizing and optimal control tool for full electric integrated fuel cell-battery system with the objective of mass minimisatoin. Sample data is based on A320 aircraft travelling 300 and 900 nautical mile distances.

##### Please download all the files to a folder and then run the model (Optimisation.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook.

##### This tool is developed as a part of Master Thesis at Technical University of Denmark (Department of Energy Conversion and Storage, and Department of Wind and Energy Systems) under the guidance of Johan Hjelm, Jinhyun Chang, Antariksh Dicholkar, and Rujie Zhu.
